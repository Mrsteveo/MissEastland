          <p class="lg:text-lg text-smtext-gray-600 px-0 lg:px-10">
            This is a mandatory competition. Contestants must submit six
            high-resolution photos on DVD on the first day of Pageant Week. We
            remind all contestants not to submit photos on USB flash drives, as
            they will remain the property of the Pageant. Photos will be judged
            on the clarity of the photo as well as its quality (in the DVD
            format in which it was submitted—not the quality in which it could
            be printed). Judges also consider personality, grooming, fashion
            sense, and the contestant’s photogenic potential and ability.
            Contestants must wear the MISS EASTLANDS® sash in all photos under
            consideration for the Miss Photogenic Award. Photos in which the
            contestant is not wearing the sash will be disqualified. MISS
            EASTLANDS® judges advise that contenders for the award be creative;
            express personal style in attire, makeup and hair; and adhere to
            professional standards with proper lighting and aesthetically
            pleasing backgrounds. MISS EASTLANDS®’S sponsorship system
            encourages contestants to seek sponsors for their photo shoot. In
            past years, most contestants have had their photos taken at no
            charge because many photographers are eager to offer their services
            in exchange for the exposure the Pageant provides. MISS EASTLANDS®
            allows photographer credits to appear at the right bottom corner of
            each picture. Pictures submitted to MISS EASTLANDS® may be used in
            publications, press releases, marketing campaigns and on contestant
            pages on the MISS EASTLANDS ORGANIZATION’S website.

            professionalism and engagement displayed in the fan page posts and
            the pages’ overall management. Please note that this contest is not
            based on the number of likes the pages receive and is separate from

            This is an optional preliminary competition. Any contestant who
            wishes to compete for the Best Talent Award should prepare a
            two-minute presentation showcasing her strongest performance talent.
            In an effort to give maximum exposure, the top five performers will
            be asked to entertain on gala night! Common talent category choices
            include singing, dancing and playing an instrument. Contestants who
            are unsure whether their talent is appropriate can seek guidance
            from the MISS EASTLANDS® team. Remember, no presentation shall
            exceed two minutes. Talents are scored based on demonstrated skills,
            costume and appearance, performance/entertainment value and overall
            impression. Contestants must make all necessary arrangements for any
            special equipment required. Please note that due to logistical
            limitations, pianos are not permitted, but performers may use
            keyboards. While the talent competition is a solo exercise,
            delegates with similar equipment needs are welcome to share, and
            those who need on-stage assistance are invited to nominate one
            partner or helper.

        This is a mandatory competition. The winner of the People’s Choice Award
        is the contestant with the highest number of votes on the MISS
        EASTLANDS® website and Facebook page combined. The winner and her tally
        will be announced at the Crowning Gala. Because of the nature of this
        competition, the People’s Choice Award is an elevated opportunity for
        public recognition and self-marketing. The winner will receive a crown
        and sash. In order to enter, contestants must provide a high resolution
        head shot, a biography not exceeding 200 words, and an introductory
        video of up to two minutes, giving your name, your home city, pertinent
        biographical details, your reason for entering the pageant and your
        plans for the future. The video must be in HD quality (that is, 720×1080
        resolution) with professional standard lighting and no background
        noises. Videos should be uploaded to the MISS EASTLANDS® YouTube
        Channel. Details about how to access the channel will be provided. When
        preparation is complete, all requested components—headshot, biography
        and YouTube link—should be sent to pageant@misseastlandsnairobi.org.
        Contestant biographies will appear on the MISS EASTLANDS® roster, in
        publications and press releases, and elsewhere; so ensure that they are
        well written. After submissions are made, no changes will be permitted.
        Although the People’s Choice Award is both a mandatory and fast-track
        competition that earns the winner a place in the top six, it is
        independent from the competition for the MISS EASTLANDS® titles that is,
        the winner of the award will not have a corresponding score counted
        toward her overall pageant tally.

        the active wear trend as long as they consist of a short top and a short
        bottom. Accessories such as glasses, hats, jewelry, etc., are welcome.
        Judges will score according to physical appearance including complexion
        and skin tone, poise, display of energy and charisma, expression of

        On-stage questions will be posed to Top Six and Top Three finalists.

        At MISS EASTLANDS® we understand that while pageants are pleasurable experiences, the combination of stiff competition and near-and-dear personal aspirations can lead to fear, stress and anxiety. We try to keep stressors to a minimum during the on-stage interview by eliminating the advent of surprise questions. Top Sixfinalists will be asked questions based on their 200-word bios. Top Three finalists will be provided with representative sample questions prior to entering the interview.
        
        The objective of the interview is to evaluate contestants’ capacity for thinking on their feet and responding ad lib. Crown holders must demonstrate their ability to answer general interest questions that may reference but are not limited to current local, regional and global issues and events.
        
        Scoring is based on overall impressions, whether contestants provide in-context answers, whether contestants show that they can handle the pressure of communicating with a large audience, and whether judges believe young people will find their personas relatable, knowledgable and influential.
